## Google App Engine Example

This example goes over how to add and retrieve data from a datastore in Google App Engine.  The example is done in Go, but any of this can be done in Python, PHP and Java, as well.

## Prereqs

Ensure that:

1. You run through the first couple steps of the [GAE introduction for Go](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/go/gettingstarted/introduction) (or your language of choice) before jumping into this example.
2. Google App Engine is installed on your computer.  You can find it [here](https://developers.google.com/appengine/downloads).
3. You have a Google account and have registered for an app engine account and domain.  (Only if you intend on deploying, though - you can run this on your local computer via "goapp serve" without a Google account.)
